Almonds are not just delicious, they can help your headache!  Migraine attacks were shown to be reduced by 41.6% (compared to 15.8% in the placebo) with regular almond consumption, so while there is some debate on the efficacy of almonds, they are certainly worth a shot if you can eat them often and are suffering from migraines.

### How do they work?

Almonds have magnesium, vitamin E and salicin.  Salicin is an anti-inflammatory agent (it is in [asprin](/remedies/Asprin/)).  The magnesium can help relax muscles, helping tension headaches.
