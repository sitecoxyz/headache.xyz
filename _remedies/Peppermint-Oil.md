Typically, a [peppermint oil roll on preparation](http://amzn.to/1OpdYrj) is used like those shown below but it is possible to make your own using [peppermint oil](http://amzn.to/1Opdstk) with a carrier oil.  Commonly [coconut oil](http://amzn.to/1OpdIs7) is used for the carrier since it is gentle on the skin but [sweet almond](http://amzn.to/1YCY2AZ) is a good choice if a liquid at room temperature is preferred ([almond](/remedies/Almonds) is also one of our natural remedies).

This should be applied to the temples as well as around the hairline.

Most importantly, be patient as it may take about 30 minutes to feel relief.

### How it works

It is thought that peppermint oil relieves tension which is the cause of many headaches.  It can also provide some slight numbing action.
