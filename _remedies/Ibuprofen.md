Ibuprofen is a common anti-inflammatory drug.  It is generally not thought of immediately when it comes to headaches but it can certainly help, especially if the cause is head or neck tension.

### Caution

It is very important to stay below the maximum daily dosage to avoid liver damage from too much ibuprofen.
