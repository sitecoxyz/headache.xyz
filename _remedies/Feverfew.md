A medicinal plant from the daisy family, feverfew is used for many ailments from headaches to stomach aches, tooth aches all the way to infertility.  

### How it works

Like many headache remedies it acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, soothing the pain of the headache.  Studies have suggested that feverfew may inhibit smooth muscle spasms.  It is thought that it does this by blocking open potassium channels.

Feverfew may additionally have anti-cancer properties.
