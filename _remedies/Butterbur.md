Butterbur is an herbal medicine.  The root, bulb and leaf were all used traditionally but modern supplements only use the leaves because high levels of potentially liver toxic alkaloids were present in the root.  75mg is generally considered an effective dosage.

### How it works

Butterbur reduces inflammation thanks to petasin and isopetasin.

### Caution

Be sure to use Butterbur that is labeled "PA free".  These pyrrolizidine alkaloids can damage the liver and must be avoided.
