Asprin is the second most common pharmaceutical remedy after [Acetaminophen](/remedies/Acetaminophen).

Asprin is healthy to take daily in small doses.  To fight a migraine however, it is commonly suggested to take almost a gram (1000mg) of asprin!

If you are comforable with that dosage and smaller dosages are not working it might be worth trying, but it is probably a bad idea to make a habit of doing that often.

### How it works

It is not fully known how asprin works on headaches but Dr Hreib from Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass has be3en quoted saying
â€œIt may be due to aspirin's ability to regulate the brain chemical serotonin or to the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin,"
