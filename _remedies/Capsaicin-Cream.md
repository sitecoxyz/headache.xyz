Capsaicin cream can be a huge help when dealing with cluster headaches.  There is a small initial burning sensation to be aware of, but as long as wounds or skin cracks are avoided it will be minor and harmless.

#### Be aware

Capsaicin cream may be contraindicated with aspirin, blood thinners, ACE inhibitors, theophylline and stomach acid reducers
